THIS IS A PROJECT ME AND MY FRIENDS CAME UP WITH IN OUR 7TH SEM FOR THE COURSE UAV TECHNOLOGY, WE IMPLEMENTED BIOD ALGORITHM ON 5 UAVS USING ARDUPILOT SITL, GAZEBO AND MAVSDK TO MAKE THEM IMITATE A BIOLOGICAL SWARM , LIKE A BIRD SWARM. THE LINK TO MY GOOGLE DRIVE IS HERE BELOW, IT HAS THE VIDEO FOR THE SIMULATION AND THE PROJECT FILES SINCE THEY WERE TOO HEAVY TO UPLOAD ON THIS REPO, THE SECOND LINK IS THAT OF BOID ALGORITHM FOR MORE CONTEXT.
